Semester 2 goals
- action selection on learned causality relationships
	2 actions are scaled to be 25 and 30, but if I pursue the 30 first, I predict that the previously 25 action will only be 5, making pursuing the 30 first more efficient
- factoring in environmental hazards when weighing decisions
	water might be in the way of a resource, making the seemingly cheap resource more expensive to get to
- can you model a combat system off of this?
	not really, because you'd have to initially spawn a FUCKTON of identical branches for 'kill enemy' or 'stay alive'
		unless branches can be re-spawned dynamically





Working Project Description:
	___ uses AI to efficiently accomplish top level goals in an environment with strict goal dependency hierarchies.
	Before simulation, ___ breaks down the top level goal's dependencies into a recursive tree of sub-goals, called a dependency tree.
	During simulation, ___ uses ML algorithms to analyze world state and player state to select and execute the most efficient sub-goal from the top level goal's dependency tree.
	After simulation, ___ trains its ML model to improve its mappings of world/player states to their corresponding sub-goal choices.


	Add:
	-	learn relations of previously pursued actions on a given action in addition to scales
	- 	randomness of environment
	-	training data vs simualtion data

NAMING CONVENTIONS:
For class, method, and file names: camel case
For variable names: snake case

		how to adapt codebase / project to other areas (as framework)
		justify model vs any other model
			why not written in prolog / other ways to manage dependencies (description of thought rather than implementation)
