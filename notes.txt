	how are multiple branches pursued if they're showing cumulative?
		upwards propagation of required resources after action completion?

	look at sims for scheduling processes

	cost with environmental factors in addition to just distance (related to time)
	cache use times for individual types so only have to evaluate one individual branch once
		costs held by PSS
	branch pruning?
		prune anything without any leaves
	how to make scales variable?
	which actions can be effectively scaled?
		path finding algorithms


	cost learned by clocking action execution times
		for variable time processes like path finding???
			different instances of path finding for different resources types
				finding trees might require different process than finding stone
			constant times like how long to hit a block are pointless to learn because it depends on tool
				is it really pointless to learn?
					potentially results in overuse of tools/excess harvested resources
	cost scalar learned by comparing anticipated time, estimated scaled time, and actual scaled time and adjusting in the direction of (actual scaled time - estimated scaled time)
		learned after task completion

	when applying scales, store predicted time in table for each unique action target

		each leaf action target calculates its estimated scaled time
		this is totalled in its parent PSS
		that parent PSS's parent PST's parent AT's parent PSS totals the total cost from all unique child child child PSS's, plus the sum cost from its child AT's

		same as
		select top level PST
		its cost equals the sum of the cheapest child PSS for each attribute
			the child PSS"s cost equals the sum of costs of child AT's plus the sum of all unique PST's
				--how to differentiate between PSTs with common PSS's
